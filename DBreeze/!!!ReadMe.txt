07.12.2012 - published on codeplex http://stsdbmtl.codeplex.com - multi-threaded layer for STSdb. 
			 Later this layer, its enhanced variant, became a prototype for DBreeze multi-threaded layer.
			 We must say, that our implementation of the search trie itself and data storage strategy
			 has nothing mutual with STSdb and has absolutely other approaches, 
			 no parts of their source code was taken or used in DBreeze production.
30.01.2012 - DBreeze name was choosen
31.01.2012 - Project is created, started core implementation.
29.03.2012 - YaskaTrie feels good! - Later became LianaTrie
12.04.2012 - LianaTrie feels good! - universal sortable search trie.
17.04.2012 - Repacked from FileDb to DBreeze solution.
